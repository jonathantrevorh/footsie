A fun alternative to intermittent compression devices

Code for the footsie device and game, from [ForgeATL hackathon](http://www.forgeatl.com/hack) Aug 22-24, 2014.

Here's a picture of the back:

### Background
Bedridden hospital patients have a high risk of blood pooling and clots which could lead to bad things. The current product for this need is an intermittent compression device, which are leg wraps which periodically pressurize to keep blood mobile. ICDs are not well recieved by patients, parents, doctors, or nurses because they are cumbersome, hinder patient mobility, and may cause skin irritation. 

### Solution
footsie encourages mobility and does not tie the patient down to the bed. The hardware component is about the size of a laptop bag, and has two foot pedals that patients actuate. It is connected to an Arduino which send pedal pressure data to a laptop, where a game is displayed.
